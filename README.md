# Emission-Tracking
The Emissions Tracking project analyzes global COâ‚‚ emissions, exploring trends across countries and energy sources like coal, oil, and gas. It involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, and visualizing patterns using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The insights help identify high-emission countries and support climate strategies.
