# Emission-Tracking

## Overview

The **Emission-Tracking** project is a data analysis initiative focused on understanding global CO₂ emissions trends. The dataset includes country-wise emissions data spanning multiple years, detailing contributions from various sources such as coal, oil, gas, cement, and flaring. The project involves comprehensive data preprocessing—including handling missing values, formatting numerical data, and structuring the dataset—before conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the analysis visualizes emission trends, identifies high-emission countries, and uncovers patterns in per capita emissions. These insights can aid policymakers and researchers in developing data-driven strategies for climate action.

## Dataset

The dataset contains CO₂ emissions data across multiple years for various countries and includes data from the following sources:

- Coal
- Oil
- Gas
- Cement
- Flaring
- Other sources

Additionally, **Per Capita Emissions** is provided as a target variable for comparative analysis.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Programming & Analysis:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization & Dashboarding:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Power BI
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Modeling:** Scikit-Learn (for regression modeling)

## Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard has been developed to visualize and explore the CO₂ emissions data. The dashboard features dynamic charts and slicers, allowing users to filter data by year, country, and energy source for a comprehensive view of global trends.

## Insights & Findings

- **Top Emitting Countries:** Identification of nations that contribute most significantly to global CO₂ emissions.
- **Energy Source Comparison:** Detailed analysis of how different energy sources (coal, oil, gas, etc.) contribute to overall emissions.
- **Per Capita Emissions Trends:** Understanding variations in per capita emissions to highlight areas that may benefit from targeted policy interventions.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into global CO₂ emissions patterns, supporting researchers and policymakers in making informed, data-driven decisions. The combination of Python-based analysis and an interactive Power BI dashboard offers a robust platform for exploring emission trends and developing strategies to reduce emissions and combat climate change.
